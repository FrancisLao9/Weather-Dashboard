## Installation

<a href="">Link to Page</a>
<a href="">Link to Respository</a>

## Usage

When the page loads, you can enter the name of a city or region into the search bar and click search. This will let the program gather and display information about the forecast for that region. To empty the page, you can click search without any input. If you would like to access a previous search, there is a history section of the page with each region that was searched.

## Contributing

I am not looking for any additional contributors for this project.
